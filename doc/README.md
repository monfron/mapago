# Cross Platform Functionality

Not all features are supported at every platform. These features
must be described and named explicetly.

## Principles

- Keep the serve size simple and configuration free from configuration
  effort. The configuration should be keep as simple as possible at the
  server side, should be done on the client side and as automatically as
  possible.
